# Biomedical_ECG

The main purpose of this project is to implement basic signal processing algorithms using Matlab
to detect some cardiac pathologies, and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to load, process and
display ECG, in order to help clinicians through their diagnosis.

This repository contains the Matlab codes for

• loading ECG signals (see Figure 1(b))

• displaying a windowed version of the signal and selecting a threshold (see Figure 1(c))

• finding a QRS complex (see Section 2.2 for further details) using a very simple threshold method
and labeling this signal with estimated positions of Q, R and S waves (see Figure 1(d))

• computing and displaying the heart rate (see Figure 1(d))

• performing unitary tests on previously defined functions
